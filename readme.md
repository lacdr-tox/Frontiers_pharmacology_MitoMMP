This repo is to simulate the models of mitochondrial membrane potential presented in a submitted work to *Frontiers in Pharmacology*. 

To generate simulations, simply run the following line a bash env. 
```shell
./run_model_simulation.sh
```
Note: running the simulations requires a couple of python packages. We provide a yml file (*MitoMMP.yml*). In the *run_model_simulation.sh* a couple of lines are commented to prepare the env. One may need to uncomment the first few lines before successfully executing the bash file.
